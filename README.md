## User Experience (UX)
- ### Customer Focus
  1. The visitor needs to be able to easily navigate the site to find the (for the customer) important content.
  2. The visitor needs to be able to easily find the contact information.
  3. The visitor needs to be able to easily find a shop.
  4. The visitor needs to be able to be inspired.

- ### Design
  - #### Color Scheme
    - The two main colors used by Küchenmontage Bülau are black and green.

  - #### Typography
    - The "Fjalla One" and "Quicksand" are used on the previous company [website](https://kuechenmontage-buelau.de/). As these fonts were readable and clean, they were used on this new site as well.

  - #### Imagery
    - Imagery is important, hence the background picture, as well as the header and navigation background are depicting a kitchen, to frame the content in an appropriate non-intrusive way.
    - The gallery is a new addition and showcases different kinds of kitchens. The intent is to display the companies craftsmanship and to provide inspiration on what kind of kitchen to purchase. Therefore the focus is on completely installed kitchens.

- ### Wireframe
  - Home Page Wireframe - [View](https://github.com/AndrosDe/kitcheninstallation-buelau/tree/main/assets/images/Screenshots/kmb_wireframe1.png)
  <br>
  As the other pages were much  simpler in layout only the home page has a Wireframe.

### Testing the User Experience (UX)
- Friends and family members were asked to review the site:
  - The gallery was well received and would be of great interest to customers looking for a new kitchen.
  - The contact information is clear and easy to find.
  - Information about the company is easy to find.
  - Legal and Impressum are less easy to find, though 98% of all visitors would not care for them.


### Further Testing
-  The Website was tested on Brave, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Safari browsers.
-  The Website was viewed on Responsinator to emulate: iPhone eXpensive, Android (Pixel 2), iPhone 6-8, iPhone 6-8 Plump, iPad
-  A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

### Known Bugs
- The navigation menu in the header can only show the website "Home" and "Gallery" with an underline, as well as the current language, "Services" and contact will not have a permanent marking as they are part of the home page. The link will work and direct the visitor to the section on the page though.
- on resolutions lower than 280px width a white gap can be seen to the right of the page. As the page is not meant to be viewed on a screen that small, no additional media queries were made to fix this, as the site becomes unreadable at that resolution anyway.
- the gallery site will take time to load since there are a lot of pictures this is to be excepted. Lowering the resolution would cause the quality of the pictures to deteriorate too much.
