- ### Design
  - #### Color Scheme
    - The two main colors used by Küchenmontage Bülau are black and green.

  - #### Typography
    - The "Fjalla One" and "Quicksand" are used on the previous company [website](https://kuechenmontage-buelau.de/). As these fonts were readable and clean, they were used on this new site as well.

  - #### Imagery
    - Imagery is important, hence the background picture, as well as the header and navigation background are depicting a kitchen, to frame the content in an appropriate non-intrusive way.
    - The gallery is a new addition and showcases different kinds of kitchens. The intent is to display the companies craftsmanship and to provide inspiration on what kind of kitchen to purchase. Therefore the focus is on completely installed kitchens.
