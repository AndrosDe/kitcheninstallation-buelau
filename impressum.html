        <h2>Disclaimer – legal notices:</h2>
        <h4>§ 1 Content Warning</h4>
        <p>
          The free and freely accessible content of this website was created with the greatest possible care. 
          However, the provider of this website assumes no liability for the accuracy and timeliness of the free and freely accessible journalistic guides and news provided. 
          Contributions marked by name reflect the opinion of the respective author and not always the opinion of the provider. 
          Simply calling up the free and freely accessible content does not result in any contractual relationship between the user and the provider, and in this respect, the provider lacks the will to be legally binding.
        </p>
        <h4>§ 2 External links</h4>
        <p>
          This website contains links to third-party websites ("external links"). These websites are the responsibility of the respective operators. 
          When the external links were first linked, the provider checked the third-party content for any legal violations. 
          At the time, no legal violations were apparent. The provider has no influence on the current and future design and content of the linked pages. 
          The setting of external links does not mean that the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link as his own. 
          Constant monitoring of the external links is not reasonable for the provider without concrete evidence of legal violations. 
          However, if we become aware of legal violations, such external links will be deleted immediately.
        </p>
        <h4>§ 3 Copyright and ancillary copyrights</h4>
        <p>
          The content published on this website is subject to German copyright and ancillary copyright. 
          Any use not permitted by German copyright and ancillary copyright law requires the prior written consent of the provider or the respective rights holder. 
          This applies in particular to the duplication, processing, translation, storage, processing, or reproduction of content in databases or other electronic media and systems. 
          Contents and rights of third parties are marked as such. 
          The unauthorized duplication or forwarding of individual content or complete pages is not permitted and is punishable by law. 
          Only the production of copies and downloads for personal, private, and non-commercial use is permitted.
        </p>
        <p>The presentation of this website in external frames is only permitted with written permission.</p>
        <h4>§ 4 Special Terms of Use</h4>
        <p>
          Insofar as special conditions for individual uses of this website deviate from the aforementioned paragraphs, this will be expressly pointed out at the appropriate point. 
          In this case, the special terms of use apply in each case.
